    <h3>INFO ABOUT ASPHALT LEGENDS UNITE</h3>
    <p>Asphalt 9: Legends is a 2018 racing game of the Asphalt series, developed by Gameloft Barcelona and published by
        Gameloft. An expansion update was released in 2024 which also renamed the title to Asphalt Legends Unite.

        In comparison to previous entries, there are several new and improved features, such as a prestigious car
        lineup, new
        control schemes, including the autopilot mode called "TouchDrive", and race modes, and the reimplemented "nitro
        shockwave" (previously known as "nitro pulse") from Asphalt 6: Adrenaline (2010). The graphics have considerably
        improved compared to its precedessor, Asphalt 8: Airborne (2013).

        On March 25, 2024, Gameloft announced an expansion update to Asphalt 9: Legends titled Asphalt Legends Unite for
        a
        release on July 17, 2024, with the game's title also renamed into the new one. A new Singapore track has been
        added upon
        an update.</p>

    <h4>More INFO</h4>
    <p>The gameplay in Asphalt Legends Unite is similar to the other Asphalt games with noticeable differences in
        graphics and
        design. There were 48 cars featured in the game when soft-launched, but the worldwide release saw the
        introduction of
        four new cars, leading to 52 cars.[1]

        There are currently 250 cars as of the Asphalt Legends Unite expansion update. Like its predecessor, each of the
        cars
        belongs to a class progressively featuring higher performance and rarity: D, C, B, A, and S. The player starts
        with the
        first car in the lowest class (Class D), the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X and ends with the strongest car in
        the
        highest class (Class S), the Devel Sixteen. All cars in the game now require blueprints to unlock and later
        "star up",
        with each of them having anywhere from 3 to 6 stars. For each new star, the car's speed, acceleration, nitro and
        efficiency is increased. Each car can also be customized with the new car editor feature. Each car now also uses
        fuel
        when used for a race event, limiting its use for any game mode. The fuel quantity for each individual car is
        based on
        the max number of possible stars for that car, e.g. 3-star cars have 6 fuel blocks, while 4-star cars have 5.
        The more
        stars a car has, the less fuel it will have.</p>
